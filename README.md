- The purpose of this study was to examine and compare the effectivness of Capomulin versus the other medications in the drug regimen for potential treatment of squamous cell carcinoma, a common form of skin cancer. 
- Capomulin and Ramicane were significantly more effective than the other drugs in the study, but Capomulin and Ramicane results were statistically neglible. See Boxplot
- Mouse weight was a factor in the effectiveness of Capomulin. The larger the mouse, the less effective the drug. (0.95) demonstrates a strong correlation of mouse weight vs tumor size. See Linear Regression
 - From my professional opinion , Capomulin is an effective treatment for skin cancer as well as Ramicane. Several studies should be performed during clinical trials to determine the dosage of Capomulin that could be effective regardless of size.
